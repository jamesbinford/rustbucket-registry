# Rustbucket Registry
Rustbucket Registry is a Django-based web application that allows users to register and manage a swarm of Rustbucket instances. 

## Functionality
Rustbucket Registry ships with the following functionality:

## Rustbucket Registration and Lifecycle Monitoring
New Rustbuckets need only be configured with the appropriate Rustbucket Registry URL and API key. The Rustbucket Registry will then automatically register the Rustbucket and provide it with a unique identifier. The Rustbucket Registry will also provide a web interface for monitoring the Rustbucket's lifecycle.

## Rustbucket Logsink and Aggregator
The Rustbucket Registry will automatically collect and aggregate logs from all registered Rustbuckets. These logs can then be accessed through the web interface.

## Pattern Analysis and Visualization using the LLM of your choice
The Rustbucket Registry will automatically analyze the logs from all registered Rustbuckets and provide a web interface for visualizing the results with help from the LLM of your choice.
